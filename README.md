## How to Run the Program 

1. Download or clone the project repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. For running the program in windows  run the main program file to start the encryption process:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   
4. For running the program in windows to conduct the known plain text attack with the crypto cracker tool, run :
   ```bash
   python crypto_cracker.py

5. For running the program in macOS  run the main program file to start the encryption process:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py

6. For running the program in macOS to conduct the known plain text attack with the crypto cracker tool, run :
   ```bash
   python3 crypto_cracker.py
